# Write an entry to the logfile specified by MIDI2HAMLIB_LOGFILE.
# If this variable is not set or is an empty string, do not do anything.
# Please note that you should set MIDI2HAMLIB_LOGFILE in a way that is robust against
# changing the working directory. As we are changing the current working 
# directory while walking through the main menu of midi2hamlib, a relative 
# pathname would result in multiple files created in different folder.
# Use something like ~/logfile.txt.
