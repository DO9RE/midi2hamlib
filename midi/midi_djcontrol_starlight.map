#DEVICE TYPE     CHAN NUM VAL SCRIPT MODE

# DJControl Starlight

# Control names consist of:
# - channel number, e.g. 0, 1, 2, ..., 6, 7.
# - type, e.g. B, K, F or P for Button, Knob, Fader or Pad.
# - value, e.g. note for buttons and pads or controller number for knobs.
# - Wheels are basically big touch-sensitive knobs, they send note_on/off
#   events as well as control-change events.
# - They have a touch-sensitive surface and a non-touch-sensitive rim.
# - Turning them with the finger on the flat surface is a different
#   controller than turning the rim.
# - They appear in three lines, the "button" of the wheel is above the "knobs".
# - They have type WB and WK for wheel button and wheel knob.

# Buttons: 15
# - 1 at the very top, in the middle above the two inner knobs.
# - 3 Buttons horizontally on the lower left and lower right.
# - 4 buttons above each group of pads. Two side by side, the other two above.
# - The button in the right button group that is second from the top seems
#   to generate note_on and note_off events on two channels. It is therefore
#   named 1+2B3, becahse it sends note 3 on channels 1 and 2.
# Faders: 3
# - 2 vertical faders at the very left and right with a detent at position 64.
# - 1 horizontal fader at the botto, separating the two groups of pads.
# Knobs: 6, all with endstops.
# - 4 at the top row, the two inner ones a litte lower than the outer ones.
#   These are continuously adjustable. 
# - 2 below the inner knobs of the top row. they hav a detent in the middle
#   position.
# Pads: 8
# - 4 on each side of the horizontal slider, grouped in a square.
# Wheels: 2
# - The wheels are located directly next to the vertical faders.
# - Touching / untouching the wheels generates a note_on / note_off event,
# - Turning the wheels while touching them only at the rim from the side
#   generates control-change events with value 1 or 127 when turning right or
#   left. this doesn't trigger the touchsensitive Wheel surfaces.
# - touching the wheels on the flat surface and turning them yields simlar 
#   control-change events as the rim, but with a different controller ID.
# Faders, knobs and wheels have a MSB and a LSB channel.
# - The MSB chanel is used in the name.
# - The LSB channel number is offfset by +32 to the MSB channel number.
